# Web-Publishing-Project

This was a group project where my team and I designed and developed a webpage about selling products on Shopee using and experimenting with HTML and CSS.

## Introduction:

### Members:

### Company Background:

We are a company started up by 4 NYP students who are very interested in User Experience (UX) Design. We were curious as to how the design of a retail website can affect a company's sales revenue. Hence, after some detailed analysis of Shopee's website as a group, together with feedback gotten from fellow customers of Shopee, we had developed a passion to help Shopee improve their customer experience. The goal of our company was to improve the usability of Shopee's website, to further improve Shopee's sales. 

### Task Allocation:

- Jingling - Products page and product description page
- Javier - Home page
- Kah Hao - Payment page
- Austin - Feedback page
